# Vacuum Negation Simulator

**A Unity-based simulation of the theoretical framework _Energy as Vacuum Negation_.**  
This project visualizes how structure, energy, and persistence emerge from an infinite true vacuum ‚Äî not through design, but through thermodynamic viability conditions.

---

## üß† Conceptual Overview

This simulation explores the idea that:

- **The true vacuum** is an infinite, geometry-less state with maximum entropy and perfect symmetry.
- **Negation** is the emergence of structure from this nullstate ‚Äî measured by deviation from entropy and symmetry.
- **Energy** is not a substance, but the **thermodynamic cost of persisting structure**.
- **Persistence** is governed by a viability equation:

- - **Negation clusters (e.g., black holes)** can become over-viable, causing inflationary propagation into the surrounding vacuum.
- **Negation cannot propagate infinitely**; it thins out, eventually reverting to vacuum ‚Äî naturally creating pockets of persistent structure and voids.
- **Persistent structures act as attractors**, increasing local viability and enabling further structure formation.

## üéØ Simulation Goals

- Demonstrate structure emerging **spontaneously** from overcompensated negation.
- Simulate **self-terminating inflation**, not through explicit boundaries but through natural viability failure.
- Show how **pockets of persistent negation** act as **viability attractors**.
- Let **voids re-form naturally** where viability falls below threshold.
- Provide a **modular framework** for theoretical experimentation and visual education.

## üóÇÔ∏è Core Modules

### 1. Simulation Grid Manager
- Manages a 2D (or optional 3D) array of `Cells`.
- Each cell holds:
- `bool IsVacuum`
- `float Entropy`
- `float Symmetry`
- `float Energy`
- `float Viability`
- `bool IsNegationSource`
- `List<Cell> Neighbors`

### 2. Negation Engine
- Computes viability `V(C, t)` per cell.
- Applies viability rules:
- If `V > 1`: structure persists/emerges.
- If `V < 1`: structure collapses (returns to vacuum).
- Factors:
- `E_in`: influenced by nearby structures.
- `E_loss`: entropy, distance, dissipation.
- `E_thresh`: minimum energy needed to persist.

### 3. Entropy Manager
- Modifies local entropy based on:
- Neighboring structure presence/absence.
- Environmental noise.
- Collapse events (increase local entropy).

### 4. Negation Propagation System
- Spreads negation to viable neighbors.
- No hardcoded range ‚Äî viability governs spread.
- Decay handled naturally through entropy and distance.

### 5. Attractor Field System
- Persistent negation emits viability bias.
- Affects neighbor cells‚Äô `E_in`, `Entropy`, or `E_thresh`.
- Can result in:
- Cluster formation.
- Structure chain reactions.
- Void reinforcement when bias is absent.

### 6. Inflation Trigger
- Special initial configuration with:
- Extremely high `E_in`
- Low `Entropy`
- High asymmetry
- Results in rapid negation expansion.
- Automatically halts when `V < 1` in outer cells.

### 7. Collapse Manager
- Monitors structure persistence.
- Collapses any structure that falls below viability threshold for N frames.
- Collapse increases entropy in local region.

### 8. Visualizer
- Visual cues:
- **Viability**: color intensity (red = high, blue = low, gray = vacuum)
- **Entropy**: noise grain overlay or distortion field
- **Attractors**: field lines or glow effects
- **Negation Type**: wavelet, particle, ripple, or collapsed zone
- Toggle views:
- Entropy map
- Viability field
- Negation source view

## üîÑ Simulation Loop

Every frame:
1. Update entropy and symmetry metrics.
2. Compute viability for each cell.
3. Propagate or decay negation accordingly.
4. Apply attractor influence.
5. Visualize updated system.
